**WORK IN PROGRESS**

A pygame-ce based engine for application and game development.

## Description

PuffKit is a collection of classes and functions that can be used to create applications and games in Python.
It is built on top of the Pygame-ce library and aims to provide a similar experience to that of the Pygame library
while adding some additional features and improvements without some of the limitations of Pygame.
